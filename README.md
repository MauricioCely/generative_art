# GENERATIVE ART WITH R: Experiments :art:

In this repo you could find the source code of the images produced  mostly with *ggplot2* and posted in my Twitter [@Mauricio_Cely](https://twitter.com/Mauricio_Cely) or in my [personal website](mauriciocely.github.io).

This work is inspired and use part of the code of [Antonio Sánchez Chinchón](https://fronkonstin.com/about/), an Spanish mathematician who has a very nice (site)[https://fronkonstin.com] with many fun and experimental applications of R.

If you have any question do not doubt to write me, perhaps I take a time but surely I will answer you.
